# TransferMatrixCalculator

TransferMatrix.py extends the capabilities of a program found on GitHub: gevero/py_matrix.

Through a GUI relying on PyQT5 the user can create a stack of dielectric materials with arbitrary dielectric tensors and simulate the reflectivity and transmissivity from the stack for any polar and azimuthal angle as well as for s- and p- polarizations for a range of wavelengths for which the dielectric functions are defined.

The output can be edited directly from the GUI using seaborn.

The right part of the GUI allows fitting using the HopfieldAgranovichModel straight from the GUI by starting Matlab:
